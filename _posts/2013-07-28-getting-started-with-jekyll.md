This morning I posted a little write up of [my experience creating this blog](http://andrewweidnerportfolio.weebly.com/1/post/2013/07/cms-free-content-management-with-github-pages.html).

Update 2013-08-25: I ran into an interesting problem today while writing [this post](http://dr3wh0.github.io/2013/08/25/scm-music-player-for-github-pages/). Jekyll automatically parses liquid tags no matter where they occur. Displaying Liquid tags in a blog post requires a workaround.

[Alex Pearce](http://alexpearce.me) developed a nice JavaScript solution: [Escaping Liquid Tags in Jekyll](http://alexpearce.me/2012/04/escaping-liquid-tags-in-jekyll/). He also wrote about [Simple Jekyll Searching](http://alexpearce.me/2012/04/simple-jekyll-searching/), another feature I'll attempt to implement.
