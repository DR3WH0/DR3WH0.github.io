It's interesting to watch how people react when a crisis appears on their radar for the first time. The Syria problem has been developing for over two years, it's finally coming to a head, and everyone now [has an opinion](https://twitter.com/search?src=typd&q=%23syria), even if they couldn't point out Syria on a map a few days ago.

Anyone interested in deep politics knows that the situation in Syria has been fabricated by intelligence agencies, military black ops, and global banking interests according to a long-term plan to [remake the Middle East](http://www.cfr.org/iraq/remaking-middle-east/p9303).

Syria will not be freed by dropping bombs. The Syrian people have suffered long enough at the hands of wicked people intent on destroying their country as they did, most recently, in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya. Before jumping on the "Free Syria" bandwagon, please take the time to learn about what is really going on:
